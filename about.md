If you've been here before, you'll find it different: this was ported into a Jekyll blog from Wordpress, to save on hosting costs for a blog I almost never use anymore. Articles that have had very few visits over the past year before the migration weren't ported.

Yes, some of these articles are pretty old, and have tons of dead links and English mistakes; and I won't fix those, they're part of the vintage. ;)
